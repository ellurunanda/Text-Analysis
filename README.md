# Real-Time Text Analysis and String Replacement App

## Overview

This is a React-based application that allows users to input text, analyze it in real time (showing unique word count and character count), and perform string replacement. Additionally, it highlights the replaced words in the displayed text as a bonus feature.

## Features

- **Real-Time Text Analysis:**
  - **Unique Word Count**: Counts the number of unique words, ignoring case.
  - **Character Count**: Counts the number of characters excluding spaces and punctuation.
  
- **String Replacement:**
  - Allows users to search for a string within the text and replace it with another string.
  - Replaces all occurrences of the search string, case-insensitive.

- **Bonus Feature:**
  - The words that are replaced in the text are highlighted in yellow after the replacement.
