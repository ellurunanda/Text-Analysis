# Real-Time Text Analysis and String Replacement App

This is a React-based application that allows users to input text, analyze it in real time (showing unique word count and character count), and perform string replacement. Additionally, it highlights the replaced words in the displayed text as a bonus feature.

## Features

  - Allows users to search for a string within the text and replace it with another string.
  - Replaces all occurrences of the search string, case-insensitive.
